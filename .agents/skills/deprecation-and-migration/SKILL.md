# Deprecation and Migration

## Overview

Code is a liability, not an asset. Every line of code has ongoing maintenance cost — bugs to fix, dependencies to update, security patches to apply, and new engineers to onboard. Deprecation is the discipline of removing code that no longer earns its keep, and migration is the process of moving users safely from the old to the new.

Most engineering organizations are good at building things. Few are good at removing them. This skill addresses that gap.

## When to Use

- Replacing an old system, API, or library with a new one
- Sunsetting a feature that's no longer needed
- Consolidating duplicate implementations
- Removing dead code that nobody owns but everybody depends on
- Planning the lifecycle of a new system (deprecation planning starts at design time)
- Deciding whether to maintain a legacy system or invest in migration

## Core Principles

### Code Is a Liability

Every line of code has ongoing cost: it needs tests, documentation, security patches, dependency updates, and mental overhead for anyone working nearby. The value of code is the functionality it provides, not the code itself. When the same functionality can be provided with less code, less complexity, or better abstractions — the old code should go.

### Hyrum's Law Makes Removal Hard

With enough users, every observable behavior becomes depended on — including bugs, timing quirks, and undocumented side effects. This is why deprecation requires active migration, not just announcement. Users can't "just switch" when they depend on behaviors the replacement doesn't replicate.

### Deprecation Planning Starts at Design Time

When building something new, ask: "How would we remove this in 3 years?" Systems designed with clean interfaces, feature flags, and minimal surface area are easier to deprecate than systems that leak implementation details everywhere.

## The Deprecation Decision

Before deprecating anything, answer these questions:

```
1. Does this system still provide unique value?
   → If yes, maintain it. If no, proceed.

2. How many users/consumers depend on it?
   → Quantify the migration scope.

3. Does a replacement exist?
   → If no, build the replacement first. Don't deprecate without an alternative.

4. What's the migration cost for each consumer?
   → If trivially automated, do it. If manual and high-effort, weigh against maintenance cost.

5. What's the ongoing maintenance cost of NOT deprecating?
   → Security risk, engineer time, opportunity cost of complexity.
```

## Compulsory vs Advisory Deprecation

| Type | When to Use | Mechanism |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Advisory** | Migration is optional, old system is stable | Warnings, documentation, nudges. Users migrate on their own timeline. |
| **Compulsory** | Old system has security issues, blocks progress, or maintenance cost is unsustainable | Hard deadline. Old system will be removed by date X. Provide migration tooling. |

**Default to advisory.** Use compulsory only when the maintenance cost or risk justifies forcing migration. Compulsory deprecation requires providing migration tooling, documentation, and support — you can't just announce a deadline.

## The Migration Process

### Step 1: Build the Replacement

Don't deprecate without a working alternative. The replacement must:

- Cover all critical use cases of the old system
- Have documentation and migration guides
- Be proven in production (not just "theoretically better")

### Step 2: Announce and Document

```markdown
## Deprecation Notice: OldService

**Status:** Deprecated as of 2025-03-01
**Replacement:** NewService (see migration guide below)
**Removal date:** Advisory — no hard deadline yet
**Reason:** OldService requires manual scaling and lacks observability.
            NewService handles both automatically.

### Migration Guide
1. Replace `import { client } from 'old-service'` with `import { client } from 'new-service'`
2. Update configuration (see examples below)
3. Run the migration verification script: `npx migrate-check`
```

### Step 3: Migrate Incrementally

Migrate consumers one at a time, not all at once. For each consumer:

```
1. Identify all touchpoints with the deprecated system
2. Update to use the replacement
3. Verify behavior matches (tests, integration checks)
4. Remove references to the old system
5. Confirm no regressions
```

**The Churn Rule:** If you own the infrastructure being deprecated, you are responsible for migrating your users — or providing backward-compatible updates that require no migration. Don't announce deprecation and leave users to figure it out.

### Step 4: Remove the Old System

Only after all consumers have migrated:

```
1. Verify zero active usage (metrics, logs, dependency analysis)
2. Remove the code
3. Remove associated tests, documentation, and configuration
4. Remove the deprecation notices
5. Celebrate — removing code is an achievement
```

## Migration Patterns

### Strangler Pattern

Run old and new systems in parallel. Route traffic incrementally from old to new. When the old system handles 0% of traffic, remove it.

```
Phase 1: New system handles 0%, old handles 100%
Phase 2: New system handles 10% (canary)
Phase 3: New system handles 50%
Phase 4: New system handles 100%, old system idle
Phase 5: Remove old system
```

### Adapter Pattern

Create an adapter that translates calls from the old interface to the new implementation. Consumers keep using the old interface while you migrate the backend.

```typescript
// Adapter: old interface, new implementation
class LegacyTaskService implements OldTaskAPI {
  constructor(private newService: NewTaskService) {}

  // Old method signature, delegates to new implementation
  getTask(id: number): OldTask {
    const task = this.newService.findById(String(id));
    return this.toOldFormat(task);
  }
}
```

### Feature Flag Migration

Use feature flags to switch consumers from old to new system one at a time:

```typescript
function getTaskService(userId: string): TaskService {
  if (featureFlags.isEnabled('new-task-service', { userId })) {
    return new NewTaskService();
  }
  return new LegacyTaskService();
}
```

## Zombie Code

Zombie code is code that nobody owns but everybody depends on. It's not actively maintained, has no clear owner, and accumulates security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues. Signs:

- No commits in 6+ months but active consumers exist
- No assigned maintainer or team
- Failing tests that nobody fixes
- Dependencies with known vulnerabilities that nobody updates
- Documentation that references systems that no longer exist

**Response:** Either assign an owner and maintain it properly, or deprecate it with a concrete migration plan. Zombie code cannot stay in limbo — it either gets investment or removal.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It still works, why remove it?" | Working code that nobody maintains accumulates security debt and complexity. Maintenance cost grows silently. |
| "Someone might need it later" | If it's needed later, it can be rebuilt. Keeping unused code "just in case" costs more than rebuilding. |
| "The migration is too expensive" | Compare migration cost to ongoing maintenance cost over 2-3 years. Migration is usually cheaper long-term. |
| "We'll deprecate it after we finish the new system" | Deprecation planning starts at design time. By the time the new system is done, you'll have new priorities. Plan now. |
| "Users will migrate on their own" | They won't. Provide tooling, documentation, and incentives — or do the migration yourself (the Churn Rule). |
| "We can maintain both systems indefinitely" | Two systems doing the same thing is double the maintenance, testing, documentation, and onboarding cost. |

## Red Flags

- Deprecated systems with no replacement available
- Deprecation announcements with no migration tooling or documentation
- "Soft" deprecation that's been advisory for years with no progress
- Zombie code with no owner and active consumers
- New features added to a deprecated system (invest in the replacement instead)
- Deprecation without measuring current usage
- Removing code without verifying zero active consumers

## Verification

After completing a deprecation:

- [ ] Replacement is production-proven and covers all critical use cases
- [ ] Migration guide exists with concrete steps and examples
- [ ] All active consumers have been migrated (verified by metrics/logs)
- [ ] Old code, tests, documentation, and configuration are fully removed
- [ ] No references to the deprecated system remain in the codebase
- [ ] Deprecation notices are removed (they served their purpose)

## Package Instructions (configured)

These instructions are enabled by the runner's native package instruction system.

## Codebase Memory Package

When performing structural code queries, prefer graph-based tools over grep:

### Tool Priority

1. **`search_graph`** — find functions, classes, routes, variables by pattern
2. **`trace_path`** — trace who calls a function or what it calls (modes: calls, data_flow, cross_service)
3. **`get_code_snippet`** — read specific function/class source code
4. **`query_graph`** — run Cypher queries for complex multi-hop patterns, aggregations, and cross-service analysis

### Architecture & Discovery

- **`get_architecture`** — high-level project summary: packages, services, dependencies, and project structure
- **`search_code`** — graph-augmented grep with modes: compact (signatures only), full (with source), files (just paths)
- **`detect_changes`** — detect code changes and their impact
- **`get_graph_schema`** — get node labels and edge types for Cypher queries

### ADR Management

- **`manage_adr`** — create or update Architecture Decision Records

### Traces & Indexing

- **`ingest_traces`** — ingest runtime traces to enhance the knowledge graph
- **`index_repository`** — index a repository. Modes: full, moderate, fast, cross-repo-intelligence
- **`list_projects`** — list all indexed projects
- **`delete_project`** — delete a project from the index
- **`index_status`** — get the indexing status of a project

### Graph Schema Reference

**Node Labels:** Project, Package, Folder, File, Module, Class, Function, Method, Interface, Enum, Type, Route, Resource

**Edge Types:** CONTAINS_PACKAGE, CONTAINS_FOLDER, CONTAINS_FILE, DEFINES, DEFINES_METHOD, IMPORTS, CALLS, HTTP_CALLS, ASYNC_CALLS, IMPLEMENTS, HANDLES, USAGE, CONFIGURES, WRITES, MEMBER_OF, TESTS, USES_TYPE, FILE_CHANGES_WITH

### Codex Tool Routing

Codex does not assume automatic search interception; call the configured codebase-memory MCP tools directly.

### Fallback Order

Fall back to file search only for non-code/config files or when graph is insufficient. Use grep/glob only for string literals, error messages, config values, or non-code files.

## Context Mode Package

Context-mode tools for large-output commands, parallel execution, and think-in-code processing.

### All Tools

- **`ctx_batch_execute`** — execute multiple commands in one call, auto-index all output, and search with multiple queries. Use concurrency 4-8 for I/O-bound batches, 1 for CPU-bound.
- **`ctx_execute`** — execute code in a sandboxed subprocess. Use for API calls, test runners, git queries, and data processing.
- **`ctx_execute_file`** — read a file and process it without loading contents into context. Use for log files, data files (CSV, JSON, XML), large source files for analysis.
- **`ctx_index`** — index documentation or knowledge content into a searchable BM25 knowledge base.
- **`ctx_search`** — search indexed content. Requires prior indexing via ctx_batch_execute, ctx_index, or ctx_fetch_and_index.
- **`ctx_fetch_and_index`** — fetches URL content, converts HTML to markdown, indexes into searchable knowledge base. Batch with concurrency 4-8 for parallel fetch.
- **`ctx_stats`** — context consumption statistics for the current session.
- **`ctx_doctor`** — diagnose context-mode installation.
- **`ctx_upgrade`** — upgrade context-mode to the latest version.
- **`ctx_purge`** — permanently delete indexed content. DESTRUCTIVE — cannot be undone.

### Tool Priority

0.MEMORY → 1.GATHER → 2.FOLLOW-UP → 3.PROCESSING → 4.WEB → 5.INDEX

### Think in Code Paradigm

Write JavaScript/TypeScript that processes FILE_CONTENT and prints only the answer. Don't manually analyze output — program the analysis. Use only Node.js built-ins (fs, path, child_process). Always wrap in try/catch. Handle null/undefined. Works on both Node.js and Bun.

### Parallel I/O Batches

For I/O-bound batches (network, gh, curl, multi-repo git reads), pass concurrency 4-8. For CPU-bound (npm test, build, lint) or stateful commands (ports, locks), keep concurrency 1.

### Output Rule

Write artifacts to FILES — never inline. Output to context only via console.log.

### Session Continuity

Skills and roles persist across the session. Search memory on resume.

### Codex Command Routing

**BLOCKED:** curl/wget, Inline HTTP (fetch, requests.get, etc.), direct web fetch outside configured context-mode MCP tools

**REDIRECTED:** Bash (>20 lines) → ctx_batch_execute/ctx_execute; Read (for analysis) → ctx_execute_file; grep/search (large results) → ctx_search after indexing

### Subagent Routing

Auto-injected.

## RTK CLI Proxy Package

Token-optimized CLI proxy. Automatic via Bash hook when installed; fallback instructions for manual use.

### Installation

- **`rtk init -g`** — install global Bash hook for automatic command interception
- Codex uses explicit RTK commands; no runner-specific RTK installer flag is assumed.

### Commands

- **Git:** `rtk git status`, `rtk git log`, `rtk git diff`, `rtk git push` (compact output)
- **Tests:** `rtk npm test`, `rtk cargo test`, `rtk pytest` (failures-only mode)
- **Docker:** `rtk docker ps`, `rtk docker logs <container>` (deduplicated)
- **Files:** `rtk ls`, `rtk read <file>`, `rtk grep <pattern>` (token-optimized)

### Analytics

- **`rtk gain`** — show token savings statistics
- **`rtk discover`** — find missed opportunities for token optimization

### Hook Bypass

Runner-native file and search tools do not pass through the Bash hook; use explicit RTK shell commands when filtering is required.

Adaptive memory is provided by the runner's configured memory system. The active provider injects its tool instructions into agent prompts.

### Automatic Scoping

Memories are scoped automatically without manual prefixes:

- **User scope**: Derived from your Supermemory token/API key. No userId needed.
- **Project scope**: Derived from x-sm-project header in MCP config. No manual scoping.

Save memories as plain content. Scoping is automatic.

### When to Save (proactive)

Save immediately after: architecture/design decisions, bug fixes (include root cause), non-obvious discoveries, configuration changes, established patterns, user preferences, gotchas or edge cases.

### Save Format

- **What**: One sentence — what was done
- **Why**: What motivated it (user request, bug, performance, etc.)
- **Where**: Files or paths affected (omit if none)
- **Learned**: Gotchas and edge cases (omit if none)

### When to Search

Reactive: "remember", "recall", "what did we do", "how did we solve", or references to past work. Proactive: when starting work that may overlap with past sessions.

### Session Close

Before ending: summarize goal, instructions, discoveries, accomplished items, next steps, and relevant files.

### Authority Rule

**OPENSPEC IS OFFICIAL CONTEXT — ADAPTIVE MEMORY IS ADVISORY.**

OpenSpec artifacts and Spec Registry are ALWAYS authoritative. Adaptive memory is advisory — it must never override official specifications.

### Fail-Open

If memory operations error or tools are unavailable: continue working normally. Never block agent work or surface errors to the user for memory issues.

### Provider: Supermemory

When the configured memory provider is "supermemory", use these MCP tools:

- `memory` (action: "save", content: "...") — commit a memory
- `memory` (action: "forget", content: "...") — remove a memory
- `recall` (query: "...", includeProfile?: boolean) — retrieve relevant memories

The Supermemory MCP server exposes these tools natively. Do not call raw MCP tools directly — use the tool names shown above.

Scoping is automatic: user from token, project from x-sm-project header. No manual containerTag required.
