# Documentation and ADRs

## Overview

Document decisions, not just code. The most valuable documentation captures the *why* — the context, constraints, and trade-offs that led to a decision. Code shows *what* was built; documentation explains *why it was built this way* and *what alternatives were considered*. This context is essential for future humans and agents working in the codebase.

## When to Use

- Making a significant architectural decision
- Choosing between competing approaches
- Adding or changing a public API
- Shipping a feature that changes user-facing behavior
- Onboarding new team members (or agents) to the project
- When you find yourself explaining the same thing repeatedly

**When NOT to use:** Don't document obvious code. Don't add comments that restate what the code already says. Don't write docs for throwaway prototypes.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture the reasoning behind significant technical decisions. They're the highest-value documentation you can write.

### When to Write an ADR

- Choosing a framework, library, or major dependency
- Designing a data model or database schema
- Selecting an authentication strategy
- Deciding on an API architecture (REST vs. GraphQL vs. tRPC)
- Choosing between build tools, hosting platforms, or infrastructure
- Any decision that would be expensive to reverse

### ADR Template

Store ADRs in `docs/decisions/` with sequential numbering:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for primary database

## Status
Accepted | Superseded by ADR-XXX | Deprecated

## Date
2025-01-15

## Context
We need a primary database for the task management application. Key requirements:
- Relational data model (users, tasks, teams with relationships)
- ACID transactions for task state changes
- Support for full-text search on task content
- Managed hosting available (for small team, limited ops capacity)

## Decision
Use PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM.

## Alternatives Considered

### MongoDB
- Pros: Flexible schema, easy to start with
- Cons: Our data is inherently relational; would need to manage relationships manually
- Rejected: Relational data in a document store leads to complex joins or data duplication

### SQLite
- Pros: Zero configuration, embedded, fast for reads
- Cons: Limited concurrent write support, no managed hosting for production
- Rejected: Not suitable for multi-user web application in production

### MySQL
- Pros: Mature, widely supported
- Cons: PostgreSQL has better JSON support, full-text search, and ecosystem tooling
- Rejected: PostgreSQL is the better fit for our feature requirements

## Consequences
- Prisma provides type-safe database access and migration management
- We can use PostgreSQL's full-text search instead of adding Elasticsearch
- Team needs PostgreSQL knowledge (standard skill, low risk)
- Hosting on managed service (Supabase, Neon, or RDS)
```

### ADR Lifecycle

```
PROPOSED → ACCEPTED → (SUPERSEDED or DEPRECATED)
```

- **Don't delete old ADRs.** They capture historical context.
- When a decision changes, write a new ADR that references and supersedes the old one.

## Inline Documentation

### When to Comment

Comment the *why*, not the *what*:

```typescript
// BAD: Restates the code
// Increment counter by 1
counter += 1;

// GOOD: Explains non-obvious intent
// Rate limit uses a sliding window — reset counter at window boundary,
// not on a fixed schedule, to prevent burst attacks at window edges
if (now - windowStart > WINDOW_SIZE_MS) {
  counter = 0;
  windowStart = now;
}
```

### When NOT to Comment

```typescript
// Don't comment self-explanatory code
function calculateTotal(items: CartItem[]): number {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}

// Don't leave TODO comments for things you should just do now
// TODO: add error handling  ← Just add it

// Don't leave commented-out code
// const oldImplementation = () => { ... }  ← Delete it, git has history
```

### Document Known Gotchas

```typescript
/**
 * IMPORTANT: This function must be called before the first render.
 * If called after hydration, it causes a flash of unstyled content
 * because the theme context isn't available during SSR.
 *
 * See ADR-003 for the full design rationale.
 */
export function initializeTheme(theme: Theme): void {
  // ...
}
```

## API Documentation

For public APIs (REST, GraphQL, library interfaces):

### Inline with Types (Preferred for TypeScript)

```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new task.
 *
 * @param input - Task creation data (title required, description optional)
 * @returns The created task with server-generated ID and timestamps
 * @throws {ValidationError} If title is empty or exceeds 200 characters
 * @throws {AuthenticationError} If the user is not authenticated
 *
 * @example
 * const task = await createTask({ title: 'Buy groceries' });
 * console.log(task.id); // "task_abc123"
 */
export async function createTask(input: CreateTaskInput): Promise<Task> {
  // ...
}
```

### OpenAPI / Swagger for REST APIs

```yaml
paths:
  /api/tasks:
    post:
      summary: Create a task
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateTaskInput'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Task created
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Task'
        '422':
          description: Validation error
```

## README Structure

Every project should have a README that covers:

```markdown
# Project Name

One-paragraph description of what this project does.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment: `cp .env.example .env`
4. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`

## Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm test` | Run tests |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run linter |

## Architecture
Brief overview of the project structure and key design decisions.
Link to ADRs for details.

## Documentation for Agents

Special consideration for AI agent context:

- **CLAUDE.md / rules files** — Document project conventions so agents follow them
- **Spec files** — Keep specs updated so agents build the right thing
- **ADRs** — Help agents understand why past decisions were made (prevents re-deciding)
- **Inline gotchas** — Prevent agents from falling into known traps

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The code is self-documenting" | Code shows what. It doesn't show why, what alternatives were rejected, or what constraints apply. |
| "We'll write docs when the API stabilizes" | APIs stabilize faster when you document them. The doc is the first test of the design. |
| "Nobody reads docs" | Agents do. Future engineers do. Your 3-months-later self does. |
| "ADRs are overhead" | A 10-minute ADR prevents a 2-hour debate about the same decision six months later. |
| "Comments get outdated" | Comments on *why* are stable. Comments on *what* get outdated — that's why you only write the former. |

## Red Flags

- Architectural decisions with no written rationale
- Public APIs with no documentation or types
- README that doesn't explain how to run the project
- Commented-out code instead of deletion
- TODO comments that have been there for weeks
- No ADRs in a project with significant architectural choices
- Documentation that restates the code instead of explaining intent

## Verification

After documenting:

- [ ] ADRs exist for all significant architectural decisions
- [ ] README covers quick start, commands, and architecture overview
- [ ] API functions have parameter and return type documentation
- [ ] Known gotchas are documented inline where they matter
- [ ] No commented-out code remains
- [ ] Rules files (CLAUDE.md etc.) are current and accurate

## Package Instructions (configured)

These instructions are enabled by the runner's native package instruction system.

## Codebase Memory Package

When performing structural code queries, prefer graph-based tools over grep:

### Tool Priority

1. **`search_graph`** — find functions, classes, routes, variables by pattern
2. **`trace_path`** — trace who calls a function or what it calls (modes: calls, data_flow, cross_service)
3. **`get_code_snippet`** — read specific function/class source code
4. **`query_graph`** — run Cypher queries for complex multi-hop patterns, aggregations, and cross-service analysis

### Architecture & Discovery

- **`get_architecture`** — high-level project summary: packages, services, dependencies, and project structure
- **`search_code`** — graph-augmented grep with modes: compact (signatures only), full (with source), files (just paths)
- **`detect_changes`** — detect code changes and their impact
- **`get_graph_schema`** — get node labels and edge types for Cypher queries

### ADR Management

- **`manage_adr`** — create or update Architecture Decision Records

### Traces & Indexing

- **`ingest_traces`** — ingest runtime traces to enhance the knowledge graph
- **`index_repository`** — index a repository. Modes: full, moderate, fast, cross-repo-intelligence
- **`list_projects`** — list all indexed projects
- **`delete_project`** — delete a project from the index
- **`index_status`** — get the indexing status of a project

### Graph Schema Reference

**Node Labels:** Project, Package, Folder, File, Module, Class, Function, Method, Interface, Enum, Type, Route, Resource

**Edge Types:** CONTAINS_PACKAGE, CONTAINS_FOLDER, CONTAINS_FILE, DEFINES, DEFINES_METHOD, IMPORTS, CALLS, HTTP_CALLS, ASYNC_CALLS, IMPLEMENTS, HANDLES, USAGE, CONFIGURES, WRITES, MEMBER_OF, TESTS, USES_TYPE, FILE_CHANGES_WITH

### Codex Tool Routing

Codex does not assume automatic search interception; call the configured codebase-memory MCP tools directly.

### Fallback Order

Fall back to file search only for non-code/config files or when graph is insufficient. Use grep/glob only for string literals, error messages, config values, or non-code files.

## Context Mode Package

Context-mode tools for large-output commands, parallel execution, and think-in-code processing.

### All Tools

- **`ctx_batch_execute`** — execute multiple commands in one call, auto-index all output, and search with multiple queries. Use concurrency 4-8 for I/O-bound batches, 1 for CPU-bound.
- **`ctx_execute`** — execute code in a sandboxed subprocess. Use for API calls, test runners, git queries, and data processing.
- **`ctx_execute_file`** — read a file and process it without loading contents into context. Use for log files, data files (CSV, JSON, XML), large source files for analysis.
- **`ctx_index`** — index documentation or knowledge content into a searchable BM25 knowledge base.
- **`ctx_search`** — search indexed content. Requires prior indexing via ctx_batch_execute, ctx_index, or ctx_fetch_and_index.
- **`ctx_fetch_and_index`** — fetches URL content, converts HTML to markdown, indexes into searchable knowledge base. Batch with concurrency 4-8 for parallel fetch.
- **`ctx_stats`** — context consumption statistics for the current session.
- **`ctx_doctor`** — diagnose context-mode installation.
- **`ctx_upgrade`** — upgrade context-mode to the latest version.
- **`ctx_purge`** — permanently delete indexed content. DESTRUCTIVE — cannot be undone.

### Tool Priority

0.MEMORY → 1.GATHER → 2.FOLLOW-UP → 3.PROCESSING → 4.WEB → 5.INDEX

### Think in Code Paradigm

Write JavaScript/TypeScript that processes FILE_CONTENT and prints only the answer. Don't manually analyze output — program the analysis. Use only Node.js built-ins (fs, path, child_process). Always wrap in try/catch. Handle null/undefined. Works on both Node.js and Bun.

### Parallel I/O Batches

For I/O-bound batches (network, gh, curl, multi-repo git reads), pass concurrency 4-8. For CPU-bound (npm test, build, lint) or stateful commands (ports, locks), keep concurrency 1.

### Output Rule

Write artifacts to FILES — never inline. Output to context only via console.log.

### Session Continuity

Skills and roles persist across the session. Search memory on resume.

### Codex Command Routing

**BLOCKED:** curl/wget, Inline HTTP (fetch, requests.get, etc.), direct web fetch outside configured context-mode MCP tools

**REDIRECTED:** Bash (>20 lines) → ctx_batch_execute/ctx_execute; Read (for analysis) → ctx_execute_file; grep/search (large results) → ctx_search after indexing

### Subagent Routing

Auto-injected.

## RTK CLI Proxy Package

Token-optimized CLI proxy. Automatic via Bash hook when installed; fallback instructions for manual use.

### Installation

- **`rtk init -g`** — install global Bash hook for automatic command interception
- Codex uses explicit RTK commands; no runner-specific RTK installer flag is assumed.

### Commands

- **Git:** `rtk git status`, `rtk git log`, `rtk git diff`, `rtk git push` (compact output)
- **Tests:** `rtk npm test`, `rtk cargo test`, `rtk pytest` (failures-only mode)
- **Docker:** `rtk docker ps`, `rtk docker logs <container>` (deduplicated)
- **Files:** `rtk ls`, `rtk read <file>`, `rtk grep <pattern>` (token-optimized)

### Analytics

- **`rtk gain`** — show token savings statistics
- **`rtk discover`** — find missed opportunities for token optimization

### Hook Bypass

Runner-native file and search tools do not pass through the Bash hook; use explicit RTK shell commands when filtering is required.

Adaptive memory is provided by the runner's configured memory system. The active provider injects its tool instructions into agent prompts.

### Automatic Scoping

Memories are scoped automatically without manual prefixes:

- **User scope**: Derived from your Supermemory token/API key. No userId needed.
- **Project scope**: Derived from x-sm-project header in MCP config. No manual scoping.

Save memories as plain content. Scoping is automatic.

### When to Save (proactive)

Save immediately after: architecture/design decisions, bug fixes (include root cause), non-obvious discoveries, configuration changes, established patterns, user preferences, gotchas or edge cases.

### Save Format

- **What**: One sentence — what was done
- **Why**: What motivated it (user request, bug, performance, etc.)
- **Where**: Files or paths affected (omit if none)
- **Learned**: Gotchas and edge cases (omit if none)

### When to Search

Reactive: "remember", "recall", "what did we do", "how did we solve", or references to past work. Proactive: when starting work that may overlap with past sessions.

### Session Close

Before ending: summarize goal, instructions, discoveries, accomplished items, next steps, and relevant files.

### Authority Rule

**OPENSPEC IS OFFICIAL CONTEXT — ADAPTIVE MEMORY IS ADVISORY.**

OpenSpec artifacts and Spec Registry are ALWAYS authoritative. Adaptive memory is advisory — it must never override official specifications.

### Fail-Open

If memory operations error or tools are unavailable: continue working normally. Never block agent work or surface errors to the user for memory issues.

### Provider: Supermemory

When the configured memory provider is "supermemory", use these MCP tools:

- `memory` (action: "save", content: "...") — commit a memory
- `memory` (action: "forget", content: "...") — remove a memory
- `recall` (query: "...", includeProfile?: boolean) — retrieve relevant memories

The Supermemory MCP server exposes these tools natively. Do not call raw MCP tools directly — use the tool names shown above.

Scoping is automatic: user from token, project from x-sm-project header. No manual containerTag required.

### Decision Examples

1. **Architecture decision made**
   - *Trigger*: Team chooses Zustand over Redux for state management
   - *Suggested topic key*: architecture/state-management
   - *Example content*: **What**: Chose Zustand over Redux. **Why**: Redux boilerplate too heavy for our use case. **Where**: src/store/.

2. **User preference correction**
   - *Trigger*: User corrects naming style assumption
   - *Suggested topic key*: preference/kevin
   - *Example content*: **What**: User prefers kebab-case CSS classes. **Where**: src/components/.

3. **Non-obvious discovery**
   - *Trigger*: Subtle memory leak found in useEffect cleanup
   - *Suggested topic key*: discovery/react-hooks-cleanup
   - *Example content*: **What**: useEffect without cleanup retains stale closures. **Where**: src/hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts.

4. **Bug fix with root cause**
   - *Trigger*: Fixed N+1 query in UserList
   - *Suggested topic key*: bugfix/n-plus-one-user-list

### Provider: Engram

When the configured memory provider is "engram", use Engram's documented tool interface. The Engram adapter injects its specific instructions; follow those instead of these generic ones.
