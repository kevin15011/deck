## Activation Contract

Load this skill only when the user explicitly asks for Judgment Day, dual/adversarial review, or equivalent Spanish trigger (`juzgar`, `que lo juzguen`). Review a specific target: files, feature, PR, or architecture slice.

## Hard Rules

- Resolve project skills before launching agents: read skill registry, match skill paths by target files/task, and inject the same `Skills to load before work` block into both judge prompts and fix prompts.
- Launch **two blind judges in parallel** with identical target and criteria; never review the code yourself.
- Wait for both judges before synthesis; never accept a partial verdict.
- Classify warnings as `WARNING (real)` only if normal intended use can trigger them; otherwise downgrade to INFO as `WARNING (theoretical)`.
- Ask before fixing Round 1 confirmed issues.
- After any fix agent runs, immediately re-launch both judges in parallel before commit/push/done/session summary.
- Terminal states are only `JUDGMENT: APPROVED` or `JUDGMENT: ESCALATED`.
- After 2 fix iterations with remaining issues, ask the user whether to continue.

## Decision Gates

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Target unclear | Ask for scope; do not launch judges. |
| No skill registry | Warn, proceed with generic criteria, and record `Skill Resolution: none`. |
| Both judges find same CRITICAL/real WARNING | Confirmed; ask/fix according to round rules. |
| One judge finds issue | Suspect; report and triage, do not auto-fix. |
| Judges contradict | Escalate for manual decision. |
| Round 2+ has only theoretical warnings/suggestions | Report as INFO; do not re-judge. |

## Execution Steps

1. Confirm target and optional custom criteria.
2. Resolve exact skill paths from registry or warn if missing.
3. Start Judge A and Judge B concurrently via delegation.
4. Synthesize findings into confirmed, suspect, contradiction, and INFO buckets.
5. Ask before Round 1 fixes; delegate a separate fix agent for confirmed approved fixes only.
6. Re-judge in parallel after fixes; repeat until approved, escalated, or user asks to stop.
7. Before any terminal action, verify every active Judgment Day has a terminal state.

## Output Contract

Return `## Judgment Day — {target}` with round number, verdict table, confirmed/suspect/contradiction counts, fixes applied, re-judgment result, `Skill Resolution`, and final `JUDGMENT: APPROVED ✅` or `JUDGMENT: ESCALATED ⚠️`.

## Package Instructions (configured)

These instructions are enabled by the runner's native package instruction system.

Adaptive memory is provided by the runner's configured memory system. Supermemory conversation capture is not production-wired on current the active runner, Pi, or Codex static-compatible paths because no trusted authenticated MCP execution boundary is exposed to Deck hooks.

### Conversation Capture

- Selecting Supermemory remains the only memory provider decision; do not add or ask for a second capture toggle, consent screen, quota, or mode selector.
- Supermemory token or OAuth credentials identify the account; Deck supplies project isolation through one Deck-materialized canonical project scope.
- Automatic scoping contract: once a real executing transport exists, one runner session must be captured as one conversation document with a stable customId and canonical project scope.
- Supermemory owns extraction, profiles, graph updates, ranking, temporal updates, and deduplication.
- Agents must not manually extract routine facts, create topic keys, fill a semantic memory quota, or write mandatory session summaries.

### Project Scope Binding

- Adaptive-memory project operations are disabled because Deck detected configured scope missing.
- Fail closed for memory and fail open for coding work: do not save, search, list, document, graph, or use save equivalents for project memory.
- Do not use a default container, active space, or an agent-derived replacement scope.
- Account-only readiness checks may still be used for authentication/status when exposed by the runner.

### Retrieval

- Load bounded project-profile context once on start/resume when healthy.
- Search only when prior context is materially relevant or the user requests recall.
- Keep recall advisory, scoped to the canonical project container, limited to five results and about 1,500 tokens by default.
- Keep query rewriting and reranking disabled unless benchmark evidence enables them.

### Privacy and Authority

- Reject or redact credentials, private keys, authorization headers, and raw environment dumps before ingestion.
- Do not automatically ingest OpenSpec artifacts, provider responses, web content, tool output, or raw logs merely because they appear in conversation.
- OPENSPEC IS OFFICIAL CONTEXT — ADAPTIVE MEMORY IS ADVISORY. OpenSpec artifacts, source, tests, and current runner evidence win.
- Fail-open: memory errors must not block coding work, continue working normally, and diagnostics must be redacted.

### Provider: Supermemory

Use the runner-exposed Supermemory tools only for bounded recall, account readiness, and explicit user forget requests. Do not pass arbitrary containerTag values; Deck owns the canonical project scope. Do not claim automatic conversation capture on unsupported/static-compatible runners.
