# Security and Hardening

## Overview

Security-first development practices for web applications. Treat every external input as hostile, every secret as sacred, and every authorization check as mandatory. Security isn't a phase — it's a constraint on every line of code that touches user data, authentication, or external systems.

## When to Use

- Building anything that accepts user input
- Implementing authentication or authorization
- Storing or transmitting sensitive data
- Integrating with external APIs or services
- Adding file uploads, webhooks, or callbacks
- Handling payment or PII data

## The Three-Tier Boundary System

### Always Do (No Exceptions)

- **Validate all external input** at the system boundary (API routes, form handlers)
- **Parameterize all database queries** — never concatenate user input into SQL
- **Encode output** to prevent XSS (use framework auto-escaping, don't bypass it)
- **Use HTTPS** for all external communication
- **Hash passwords** with bcrypt/scrypt/argon2 (never store plaintext)
- **Set security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- **Use httpOnly, secure, sameSite cookies** for sessions
- **Run `npm audit`** (or equivalent) before every release

### Ask First (Requires Human Approval)

- Adding new authentication flows or changing auth logic
- Storing new categories of sensitive data (PII, payment info)
- Adding new external service integrations
- Changing CORS configuration
- Adding file upload handlers
- Modifying rate limiting or throttling
- Granting elevated permissions or roles

### Never Do

- **Never commit secrets** to version control (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, full credit card numbers)
- **Never trust client-side validation** as a security boundary
- **Never disable security headers** for convenience
- **Never use `eval()` or `innerHTML`** with user-provided data
- **Never store sessions in client-accessible storage** (localStorage for auth tokens)
- **Never expose stack traces** or internal error details to users

## OWASP Top 10 Prevention

### 1. Injection (SQL, NoSQL, OS Command)

```typescript
// BAD: SQL injection via string concatenation
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${userId}'`;

// GOOD: Parameterized query
const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId]);

// GOOD: ORM with parameterized input
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
```

### 2. Broken Authentication

```typescript
// Password hashing
import { hash, compare } from 'bcrypt';

const SALT_ROUNDS = 12;
const hashedPassword = await hash(plaintext, SALT_ROUNDS);
const isValid = await compare(plaintext, hashedPassword);

// Session management
app.use(session({
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,  // From environment, not code
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    httpOnly: true,     // Not accessible via JavaScript
    secure: true,       // HTTPS only
    sameSite: 'lax',    // CSRF protection
    maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,  // 24 hours
  },
}));
```

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

```typescript
// BAD: Rendering user input as HTML
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// GOOD: Use framework auto-escaping (React does this by default)
return <div>{userInput}</div>;

// If you MUST render HTML, sanitize first
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
const clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

### 4. Broken Access Control

```typescript
// Always check authorization, not just authentication
app.patch('/api/tasks/:id', authenticate, async (req, res) => {
  const task = await taskService.findById(req.params.id);

  // Check that the authenticated user owns this resource
  if (task.ownerId !== req.user.id) {
    return res.status(403).json({
      error: { code: 'FORBIDDEN', message: 'Not authorized to modify this task' }
    });
  }

  // Proceed with update
  const updated = await taskService.update(req.params.id, req.body);
  return res.json(updated);
});
```

### 5. Security Misconfiguration

```typescript
// Security headers (use helmet for Express)
import helmet from 'helmet';
app.use(helmet());

// Content Security Policy
app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
    styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],  // Tighten if possible
    imgSrc: ["'self'", 'data:', 'https:'],
    connectSrc: ["'self'"],
  },
}));

// CORS — restrict to known origins
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(',') || 'http://localhost:3000',
  credentials: true,
}));
```

### 6. Sensitive Data Exposure

```typescript
// Never return sensitive fields in API responses
function sanitizeUser(user: UserRecord): PublicUser {
  const { passwordHash, resetToken, ...publicFields } = user;
  return publicFields;
}

// Use environment variables for secrets
const API_KEY = process.env.STRIPE_API_KEY;
if (!API_KEY) throw new Error('STRIPE_API_KEY not configured');
```

## Input Validation Patterns

### Schema Validation at Boundaries

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const CreateTaskSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1).max(200).trim(),
  description: z.string().max(2000).optional(),
  priority: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']).default('medium'),
  dueDate: z.string().datetime().optional(),
});

// Validate at the route handler
app.post('/api/tasks', async (req, res) => {
  const result = CreateTaskSchema.safeParse(req.body);
  if (!result.success) {
    return res.status(422).json({
      error: {
        code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR',
        message: 'Invalid input',
        details: result.error.flatten(),
      },
    });
  }
  // result.data is now typed and validated
  const task = await taskService.create(result.data);
  return res.status(201).json(task);
});
```

### File Upload Safety

```typescript
// Restrict file types and sizes
const ALLOWED_TYPES = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp'];
const MAX_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB

function validateUpload(file: UploadedFile) {
  if (!ALLOWED_TYPES.includes(file.mimetype)) {
    throw new ValidationError('File type not allowed');
  }
  if (file.size > MAX_SIZE) {
    throw new ValidationError('File too large (max 5MB)');
  }
  // Don't trust the file extension — check magic bytes if critical
}
```

## Triaging npm audit Results

Not all audit findings require immediate action. Use this decision tree:

```
npm audit reports a vulnerability
├── Severity: critical or high
│   ├── Is the vulnerable code reachable in your app?
│   │   ├── YES --> Fix immediately (update, patch, or replace the dependency)
│   │   └── NO (dev-only dep, unused code path) --> Fix soon, but not a blocker
│   └── Is a fix available?
│       ├── YES --> Update to the patched version
│       └── NO --> Check for workarounds, consider replacing the dependency, or add to allowlist with a review date
├── Severity: moderate
│   ├── Reachable in production? --> Fix in the next release cycle
│   └── Dev-only? --> Fix when convenient, track in backlog
└── Severity: low
    └── Track and fix during regular dependency updates
```

**Key questions:**
- Is the vulnerable function actually called in your code path?
- Is the dependency a runtime dependency or dev-only?
- Is the vulnerability exploitable given your deployment context (e.g., a server-side vulnerability in a client-only app)?

When you defer a fix, document the reason and set a review date.

## Rate Limiting

```typescript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

// General API rate limit
app.use('/api/', rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100,                   // 100 requests per window
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
}));

// Stricter limit for auth endpoints
app.use('/api/auth/', rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 10,  // 10 attempts per 15 minutes
}));
```

## Secrets Management

```
.env files:
  ├── .env.example  → Committed (template with placeholder values)
  ├── .env          → NOT committed (contains real secrets)
  └── .env.local    → NOT committed (local overrides)

.gitignore must include:
  .env
  .env.local
  .env.*.local
  *.pem
  *.key
```

**Always check before committing:**
```bash
# Check for accidentally staged secrets
git diff --cached | grep -i "password\|secret\|api_key\|token"
```

## Security Review Checklist

```markdown
### Authentication
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt/scrypt/argon2 (salt rounds ≥ 12)
- [ ] Session tokens are httpOnly, secure, sameSite
- [ ] Login has rate limiting
- [ ] Password reset tokens expire

### Authorization
- [ ] Every endpoint checks user permissions
- [ ] Users can only access their own resources
- [ ] Admin actions require admin role verification

### Input
- [ ] All user input validated at the boundary
- [ ] SQL queries are parameterized
- [ ] HTML output is encoded/escaped

### Data
- [ ] No secrets in code or version control
- [ ] Sensitive fields excluded from API responses
- [ ] PII encrypted at rest (if applicable)

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] CORS restricted to known origins
- [ ] Dependencies audited for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Error messages don't expose internals
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This is an internal tool, security doesn't matter" | Internal tools get compromised. Attackers target the weakest link. |
| "We'll add security later" | Security retrofitting is 10x harder than building it in. Add it now. |
| "No one would try to exploit this" | Automated scanners will find it. Security by obscurity is not security. |
| "The framework handles security" | Frameworks provide tools, not guarantees. You still need to use them correctly. |
| "It's just a prototype" | Prototypes become production. Security habits from day one. |

## Red Flags

- User input passed directly to database queries, shell commands, or HTML rendering
- Secrets in source code or commit history
- API endpoints without authentication or authorization checks
- Missing CORS configuration or wildcard (`*`) origins
- No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Stack traces or internal errors exposed to users
- Dependencies with known critical vulnerabilities

## Verification

After implementing security-relevant code:

- [ ] `npm audit` shows no critical or high vulnerabilities
- [ ] No secrets in source code or git history
- [ ] All user input validated at system boundaries
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checked on every protected endpoint
- [ ] Security headers present in response (check with browser DevTools)
- [ ] Error responses don't expose internal details
- [ ] Rate limiting active on auth endpoints

## Package Instructions (configured)

These instructions are enabled by the runner's native package instruction system.

## Codebase Memory Package

When performing structural code queries, prefer graph-based tools over grep:

### Tool Priority

1. **`search_graph`** — find functions, classes, routes, variables by pattern
2. **`trace_path`** — trace who calls a function or what it calls (modes: calls, data_flow, cross_service)
3. **`get_code_snippet`** — read specific function/class source code
4. **`query_graph`** — run Cypher queries for complex multi-hop patterns, aggregations, and cross-service analysis

### Architecture & Discovery

- **`get_architecture`** — high-level project summary: packages, services, dependencies, and project structure
- **`search_code`** — graph-augmented grep with modes: compact (signatures only), full (with source), files (just paths)
- **`detect_changes`** — detect code changes and their impact
- **`get_graph_schema`** — get node labels and edge types for Cypher queries

### ADR Management

- **`manage_adr`** — create or update Architecture Decision Records

### Traces & Indexing

- **`ingest_traces`** — ingest runtime traces to enhance the knowledge graph
- **`index_repository`** — index a repository. Modes: full, moderate, fast, cross-repo-intelligence
- **`list_projects`** — list all indexed projects
- **`delete_project`** — delete a project from the index
- **`index_status`** — get the indexing status of a project

### Graph Schema Reference

**Node Labels:** Project, Package, Folder, File, Module, Class, Function, Method, Interface, Enum, Type, Route, Resource

**Edge Types:** CONTAINS_PACKAGE, CONTAINS_FOLDER, CONTAINS_FILE, DEFINES, DEFINES_METHOD, IMPORTS, CALLS, HTTP_CALLS, ASYNC_CALLS, IMPLEMENTS, HANDLES, USAGE, CONFIGURES, WRITES, MEMBER_OF, TESTS, USES_TYPE, FILE_CHANGES_WITH

### Codex Tool Routing

Codex does not assume automatic search interception; call the configured codebase-memory MCP tools directly.

### Fallback Order

Fall back to file search only for non-code/config files or when graph is insufficient. Use grep/glob only for string literals, error messages, config values, or non-code files.

## Context Mode Package

Context-mode tools for large-output commands, parallel execution, and think-in-code processing.

### All Tools

- **`ctx_batch_execute`** — execute multiple commands in one call, auto-index all output, and search with multiple queries. Use concurrency 4-8 for I/O-bound batches, 1 for CPU-bound.
- **`ctx_execute`** — execute code in a sandboxed subprocess. Use for API calls, test runners, git queries, and data processing.
- **`ctx_execute_file`** — read a file and process it without loading contents into context. Use for log files, data files (CSV, JSON, XML), large source files for analysis.
- **`ctx_index`** — index documentation or knowledge content into a searchable BM25 knowledge base.
- **`ctx_search`** — search indexed content. Requires prior indexing via ctx_batch_execute, ctx_index, or ctx_fetch_and_index.
- **`ctx_fetch_and_index`** — fetches URL content, converts HTML to markdown, indexes into searchable knowledge base. Batch with concurrency 4-8 for parallel fetch.
- **`ctx_stats`** — context consumption statistics for the current session.
- **`ctx_doctor`** — diagnose context-mode installation.
- **`ctx_upgrade`** — upgrade context-mode to the latest version.
- **`ctx_purge`** — permanently delete indexed content. DESTRUCTIVE — cannot be undone.

### Tool Priority

0.MEMORY → 1.GATHER → 2.FOLLOW-UP → 3.PROCESSING → 4.WEB → 5.INDEX

### Think in Code Paradigm

Write JavaScript/TypeScript that processes FILE_CONTENT and prints only the answer. Don't manually analyze output — program the analysis. Use only Node.js built-ins (fs, path, child_process). Always wrap in try/catch. Handle null/undefined. Works on both Node.js and Bun.

### Parallel I/O Batches

For I/O-bound batches (network, gh, curl, multi-repo git reads), pass concurrency 4-8. For CPU-bound (npm test, build, lint) or stateful commands (ports, locks), keep concurrency 1.

### Output Rule

Write artifacts to FILES — never inline. Output to context only via console.log.

### Session Continuity

Skills and roles persist across the session. Search memory on resume.

### Codex Command Routing

**BLOCKED:** curl/wget, Inline HTTP (fetch, requests.get, etc.), direct web fetch outside configured context-mode MCP tools

**REDIRECTED:** Bash (>20 lines) → ctx_batch_execute/ctx_execute; Read (for analysis) → ctx_execute_file; grep/search (large results) → ctx_search after indexing

### Subagent Routing

Auto-injected.

## RTK CLI Proxy Package

Token-optimized CLI proxy. Automatic via Bash hook when installed; fallback instructions for manual use.

### Installation

- **`rtk init -g`** — install global Bash hook for automatic command interception
- Codex uses explicit RTK commands; no runner-specific RTK installer flag is assumed.

### Commands

- **Git:** `rtk git status`, `rtk git log`, `rtk git diff`, `rtk git push` (compact output)
- **Tests:** `rtk npm test`, `rtk cargo test`, `rtk pytest` (failures-only mode)
- **Docker:** `rtk docker ps`, `rtk docker logs <container>` (deduplicated)
- **Files:** `rtk ls`, `rtk read <file>`, `rtk grep <pattern>` (token-optimized)

### Analytics

- **`rtk gain`** — show token savings statistics
- **`rtk discover`** — find missed opportunities for token optimization

### Hook Bypass

Runner-native file and search tools do not pass through the Bash hook; use explicit RTK shell commands when filtering is required.

Adaptive memory is provided by the runner's configured memory system. The active provider injects its tool instructions into agent prompts.

### Automatic Scoping

Memories are scoped automatically without manual prefixes:

- **User scope**: Derived from your Supermemory token/API key. No userId needed.
- **Project scope**: Derived from x-sm-project header in MCP config. No manual scoping.

Save memories as plain content. Scoping is automatic.

### When to Save (proactive)

Save immediately after: architecture/design decisions, bug fixes (include root cause), non-obvious discoveries, configuration changes, established patterns, user preferences, gotchas or edge cases.

### Save Format

- **What**: One sentence — what was done
- **Why**: What motivated it (user request, bug, performance, etc.)
- **Where**: Files or paths affected (omit if none)
- **Learned**: Gotchas and edge cases (omit if none)

### When to Search

Reactive: "remember", "recall", "what did we do", "how did we solve", or references to past work. Proactive: when starting work that may overlap with past sessions.

### Session Close

Before ending: summarize goal, instructions, discoveries, accomplished items, next steps, and relevant files.

### Authority Rule

**OPENSPEC IS OFFICIAL CONTEXT — ADAPTIVE MEMORY IS ADVISORY.**

OpenSpec artifacts and Spec Registry are ALWAYS authoritative. Adaptive memory is advisory — it must never override official specifications.

### Fail-Open

If memory operations error or tools are unavailable: continue working normally. Never block agent work or surface errors to the user for memory issues.

### Provider: Supermemory

When the configured memory provider is "supermemory", use these MCP tools:

- `memory` (action: "save", content: "...") — commit a memory
- `memory` (action: "forget", content: "...") — remove a memory
- `recall` (query: "...", includeProfile?: boolean) — retrieve relevant memories

The Supermemory MCP server exposes these tools natively. Do not call raw MCP tools directly — use the tool names shown above.

Scoping is automatic: user from token, project from x-sm-project header. No manual containerTag required.

### Provider: Engram

When the configured memory provider is "engram", use Engram's documented tool interface. The Engram adapter injects its specific instructions; follow those instead of these generic ones.
