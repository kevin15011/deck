# Web quality audit

Comprehensive quality review based on Google Lighthouse audits. Covers Performance, Accessibility, SEO, and Best Practices across 150+ checks.

> **Lighthouse v13 note (Oct 2025+).** Lighthouse has migrated the Performance category from per-opportunity audits to **Performance Insight Audits** ([announcement](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/moving-lighthouse-to-insights)). Several individual audit names this skill historically referenced — *First Meaningful Paint*, *No Document Write*, *Uses Passive Event Listeners*, *Uses Rel Preload* — have been removed or merged. The underlying *advice* is unchanged and still applies; only the report format moved. The CLS-related audits ("layout shifts", "non-composited animations", "unsized images") are now consolidated into a single `cls-culprits-insight`, and image audits are merged into `image-delivery-insight`. Treat older Lighthouse JSON output as a superset, not a contradiction.

## How it works

1. Analyze the provided code/project for quality issues
2. Categorize findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Provide specific, actionable recommendations
4. Include code examples for fixes

## Audit categories

### Performance (40% of typical issues)

**Core Web Vitals** — Must pass for good page experience:
* **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s.** The largest visible element must render quickly. Optimize images, fonts, and server response time.
* **INP (Interaction to Next Paint) < 200ms.** User interactions must feel instant. Reduce JavaScript execution time and break up long tasks.
* **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1.** Content must not jump around. Set explicit dimensions on images, embeds, and ads.

**Resource Optimization:**
* **Compress images.** Use WebP/AVIF with fallbacks. Serve correctly sized images via `srcset`.
* **Minimize JavaScript.** Remove unused code. Use code splitting. Defer non-critical scripts.
* **Optimize CSS.** Extract critical CSS. Remove unused styles. Avoid `@import`.
* **Efficient fonts.** Use `font-display: swap`. Preload critical fonts. Subset to needed characters.

**Loading Strategy:**
* **Preconnect to origins.** Add `<link rel="preconnect">` for third-party domains.
* **Preload critical assets.** LCP images, fonts, and above-fold CSS.
* **Lazy load below-fold content.** Images, iframes, and heavy components.
* **Cache effectively.** Long cache TTLs for static assets. Immutable caching for hashed files.

### Accessibility (30% of typical issues)

**Perceivable:**
* **Text alternatives.** Every `<img>` has meaningful `alt` text. Decorative images use `alt=""`.
* **Color contrast.** Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (WCAG AA).
* **Don't rely on color alone.** Use icons, patterns, or text alongside color indicators.
* **Captions and transcripts.** Video has captions. Audio has transcripts.

**Operable:**
* **Keyboard accessible.** All functionality available via keyboard. No keyboard traps.
* **Focus visible.** Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements.
* **Skip links.** Provide "Skip to main content" for keyboard users.
* **Sufficient time.** Users can extend time limits. No auto-advancing content without controls.

**Understandable:**
* **Page language.** Set `lang` attribute on `<html>`.
* **Consistent navigation.** Same navigation structure across pages.
* **Error identification.** Form errors clearly described and associated with fields.
* **Labels and instructions.** All form inputs have associated labels.

**Robust:**
* **Valid HTML.** No duplicate IDs. Properly nested elements.
* **ARIA used correctly.** Prefer native elements. ARIA roles match behavior.
* **Name, role, value.** Interactive elements have accessible names and correct roles.

### SEO (15% of typical issues)

**Crawlability:**
* **Valid robots.txt.** Doesn't block important resources.
* **XML sitemap.** Lists all important pages. Submitted to Search Console.
* **Canonical URLs.** Prevent duplicate content issues.
* **No noindex on important pages.** Check meta robots and headers.

**On-Page SEO:**
* **Unique title tags.** 50-60 characters. Primary keyword included.
* **Meta descriptions.** 150-160 characters. Compelling and unique.
* **Heading hierarchy.** Single `<h1>`. Logical heading structure.
* **Descriptive link text.** Not "click here" or "read more".

**Technical SEO:**
* **Mobile-friendly.** Responsive design. Tap targets ≥ 48px.
* **HTTPS.** Secure connection required.
* **Fast loading.** Performance directly impacts ranking.
* **Structured data.** JSON-LD for rich snippets (Article, Product, FAQ, etc.).

### Best practices (15% of typical issues)

**Security:**
* **HTTPS everywhere.** No mixed content. HSTS enabled.
* **No vulnerable libraries.** Keep dependencies updated.
* **CSP headers.** Content Security Policy to prevent XSS.
* **No exposed source maps.** In production builds.

**Modern Standards:**
* **No deprecated APIs.** Replace `document.write`, synchronous XHR, etc.
* **Valid doctype.** Use `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
* **Charset declared.** `<meta charset="UTF-8">` as first element in `<head>`.
* **No browser errors.** Clean console. No CORS issues.

**UX Patterns:**
* **No intrusive interstitials.** Especially on mobile.
* **Clear permission requests.** Only ask when needed, with context.
* **No misleading buttons.** Buttons do what they say.

## Package Instructions (configured)

These instructions are enabled by the runner's native package instruction system.

## Codebase Memory Package

When performing structural code queries, prefer graph-based tools over grep:

### Tool Priority

1. **`search_graph`** — find functions, classes, routes, variables by pattern
2. **`trace_path`** — trace who calls a function or what it calls (modes: calls, data_flow, cross_service)
3. **`get_code_snippet`** — read specific function/class source code
4. **`query_graph`** — run Cypher queries for complex multi-hop patterns, aggregations, and cross-service analysis

### Architecture & Discovery

- **`get_architecture`** — high-level project summary: packages, services, dependencies, and project structure
- **`search_code`** — graph-augmented grep with modes: compact (signatures only), full (with source), files (just paths)
- **`detect_changes`** — detect code changes and their impact
- **`get_graph_schema`** — get node labels and edge types for Cypher queries

### ADR Management

- **`manage_adr`** — create or update Architecture Decision Records

### Traces & Indexing

- **`ingest_traces`** — ingest runtime traces to enhance the knowledge graph
- **`index_repository`** — index a repository. Modes: full, moderate, fast, cross-repo-intelligence
- **`list_projects`** — list all indexed projects
- **`delete_project`** — delete a project from the index
- **`index_status`** — get the indexing status of a project

### Graph Schema Reference

**Node Labels:** Project, Package, Folder, File, Module, Class, Function, Method, Interface, Enum, Type, Route, Resource

**Edge Types:** CONTAINS_PACKAGE, CONTAINS_FOLDER, CONTAINS_FILE, DEFINES, DEFINES_METHOD, IMPORTS, CALLS, HTTP_CALLS, ASYNC_CALLS, IMPLEMENTS, HANDLES, USAGE, CONFIGURES, WRITES, MEMBER_OF, TESTS, USES_TYPE, FILE_CHANGES_WITH

### Codex Tool Routing

Codex does not assume automatic search interception; call the configured codebase-memory MCP tools directly.

### Fallback Order

Fall back to file search only for non-code/config files or when graph is insufficient. Use grep/glob only for string literals, error messages, config values, or non-code files.

## Context Mode Package

Context-mode tools for large-output commands, parallel execution, and think-in-code processing.

### All Tools

- **`ctx_batch_execute`** — execute multiple commands in one call, auto-index all output, and search with multiple queries. Use concurrency 4-8 for I/O-bound batches, 1 for CPU-bound.
- **`ctx_execute`** — execute code in a sandboxed subprocess. Use for API calls, test runners, git queries, and data processing.
- **`ctx_execute_file`** — read a file and process it without loading contents into context. Use for log files, data files (CSV, JSON, XML), large source files for analysis.
- **`ctx_index`** — index documentation or knowledge content into a searchable BM25 knowledge base.
- **`ctx_search`** — search indexed content. Requires prior indexing via ctx_batch_execute, ctx_index, or ctx_fetch_and_index.
- **`ctx_fetch_and_index`** — fetches URL content, converts HTML to markdown, indexes into searchable knowledge base. Batch with concurrency 4-8 for parallel fetch.
- **`ctx_stats`** — context consumption statistics for the current session.
- **`ctx_doctor`** — diagnose context-mode installation.
- **`ctx_upgrade`** — upgrade context-mode to the latest version.
- **`ctx_purge`** — permanently delete indexed content. DESTRUCTIVE — cannot be undone.

### Tool Priority

0.MEMORY → 1.GATHER → 2.FOLLOW-UP → 3.PROCESSING → 4.WEB → 5.INDEX

### Think in Code Paradigm

Write JavaScript/TypeScript that processes FILE_CONTENT and prints only the answer. Don't manually analyze output — program the analysis. Use only Node.js built-ins (fs, path, child_process). Always wrap in try/catch. Handle null/undefined. Works on both Node.js and Bun.

### Parallel I/O Batches

For I/O-bound batches (network, gh, curl, multi-repo git reads), pass concurrency 4-8. For CPU-bound (npm test, build, lint) or stateful commands (ports, locks), keep concurrency 1.

### Output Rule

Write artifacts to FILES — never inline. Output to context only via console.log.

### Session Continuity

Skills and roles persist across the session. Search memory on resume.

### Codex Command Routing

**BLOCKED:** curl/wget, Inline HTTP (fetch, requests.get, etc.), direct web fetch outside configured context-mode MCP tools

**REDIRECTED:** Bash (>20 lines) → ctx_batch_execute/ctx_execute; Read (for analysis) → ctx_execute_file; grep/search (large results) → ctx_search after indexing

### Subagent Routing

Auto-injected.

## RTK CLI Proxy Package

Token-optimized CLI proxy. Automatic via Bash hook when installed; fallback instructions for manual use.

### Installation

- **`rtk init -g`** — install global Bash hook for automatic command interception
- Codex uses explicit RTK commands; no runner-specific RTK installer flag is assumed.

### Commands

- **Git:** `rtk git status`, `rtk git log`, `rtk git diff`, `rtk git push` (compact output)
- **Tests:** `rtk npm test`, `rtk cargo test`, `rtk pytest` (failures-only mode)
- **Docker:** `rtk docker ps`, `rtk docker logs <container>` (deduplicated)
- **Files:** `rtk ls`, `rtk read <file>`, `rtk grep <pattern>` (token-optimized)

### Analytics

- **`rtk gain`** — show token savings statistics
- **`rtk discover`** — find missed opportunities for token optimization

### Hook Bypass

Runner-native file and search tools do not pass through the Bash hook; use explicit RTK shell commands when filtering is required.

Adaptive memory is provided by the runner's configured memory system. The active provider injects its tool instructions into agent prompts.

### Automatic Scoping

Memories are scoped automatically without manual prefixes:

- **User scope**: Derived from your Supermemory token/API key. No userId needed.
- **Project scope**: Derived from x-sm-project header in MCP config. No manual scoping.

Save memories as plain content. Scoping is automatic.

### When to Save (proactive)

Save immediately after: architecture/design decisions, bug fixes (include root cause), non-obvious discoveries, configuration changes, established patterns, user preferences, gotchas or edge cases.

### Save Format

- **What**: One sentence — what was done
- **Why**: What motivated it (user request, bug, performance, etc.)
- **Where**: Files or paths affected (omit if none)
- **Learned**: Gotchas and edge cases (omit if none)

### When to Search

Reactive: "remember", "recall", "what did we do", "how did we solve", or references to past work. Proactive: when starting work that may overlap with past sessions.

### Session Close

Before ending: summarize goal, instructions, discoveries, accomplished items, next steps, and relevant files.

### Authority Rule

**OPENSPEC IS OFFICIAL CONTEXT — ADAPTIVE MEMORY IS ADVISORY.**

OpenSpec artifacts and Spec Registry are ALWAYS authoritative. Adaptive memory is advisory — it must never override official specifications.

### Fail-Open

If memory operations error or tools are unavailable: continue working normally. Never block agent work or surface errors to the user for memory issues.

### Provider: Supermemory

When the configured memory provider is "supermemory", use these MCP tools:

- `memory` (action: "save", content: "...") — commit a memory
- `memory` (action: "forget", content: "...") — remove a memory
- `recall` (query: "...", includeProfile?: boolean) — retrieve relevant memories

The Supermemory MCP server exposes these tools natively. Do not call raw MCP tools directly — use the tool names shown above.

Scoping is automatic: user from token, project from x-sm-project header. No manual containerTag required.
